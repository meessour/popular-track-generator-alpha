## 6. API

[REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu) is used to fetch countries data as JSON.

Additional data is requested and shown in the detail page.
<br/>
There aren't any restrictions mentioned in the docs of REST Countries.

## 7. Best practices & Design patterns
Best practices:
- ~~Strict mode~~ (not needed with ES6 modules)
- Constants instead of variables
- CamelCase
- Line length under 80
- End statements with semicolon
- Avoid else, return early
- Single quotes for strings

Design patterns:
+ ~~IIFE~~ (not needed with ES6 modules)
